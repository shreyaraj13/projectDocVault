This project deals with IMPLEMENTATION OF DOCUMENT MANAGEMENT FOR COLLEGE USING WEB TECHNOLOGIES.

Bringing technology into classrooms has had a positive impact on the quality of education delivered. Students and teachers unanimously agree upon the benefits of using e-Documents in education. The aim of DocVault is to simplify and enhance the overall learning experience. Digital Books make the learning process more interactive and engaging.
After covid-19 outbreak, online classes have become a necessity and so have online notes by the teachers and fellow students. This project solves the problem of bulk sharing of notes on the social media chat platforms like WHATSAPP and places it in a different and dedicated place for documents where students and teachers can upload, read, download and upload documents.
